HOW TO RUN: Open the project in VSCode and click "Run and Debug." After the browser tab opens up, go into the Debug Console and look through the white text until you find the URL with "http" instead of "https" at the beginning of this. Copy and paste this into an API platform, and then edit the URL to add "/GreaterThan/greater/{number1}/{number2}" at the end, but type the numbers you want to compare instead of {number1} and {number2}. After you've done this, hit enter, and the screen should show a string of text saying which of your numbers is less than or greater than the other, or that they are equal if the numbers are both equal.

Peer Review by Carlos Felipe: This program works well. It correctly tells me which number is greater than, less than, or equal to which. The comments in the controller code are well written and tell me precisely what is going on. Overall great job.
